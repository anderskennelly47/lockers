# lockers:

100 students approach 100 lockers.



Student 1 opens all of them, starting with locker 1.



Student 2 goes down the line and closes every second locker, starting with locker 2.



Student 3 changes the state of every third locker, starting with locker 3 â€” if it is open, it gets closed, and if it is closed, it gets opened.



And so on, until all one hundred students have taken a turn changing the state of the lockers.
